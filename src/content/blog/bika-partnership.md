# Europe meets South Africa

<!-- {{< tweet 677201899674800129 >}} -->

Since December 15, 2015 RIDING BYTES and Bika Labs (South Africa) are official Partners.

[Bika Labs](http://bikalabs.com) provides up-market Open Source
[Laboratory Information Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_information_management_system)
based on the enterprise [CMS Plone](https://plone.org).

RIDING BYTES supports Bika Labs with interfacing LIMS to other systems and
mobile application development.

Looking forward to many interesting projects and a lot of technical opportunities.
