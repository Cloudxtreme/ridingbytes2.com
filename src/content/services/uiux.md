# UI/UX

These two terms stand for *User Interface* and *User Experience*. While the
first one is mainly concerned with the layout of application elements, the
latter one cares about how the interaction with the application feels to the user.

Both terms are linked to each other and highly influence the user acceptance of
the finished application/product.

RIDING BYTES is specialized in web based user interfaces, which provide a great
user experience by logical application flows and an intuitive layout.  We offer
consulting, support and development of custom web-, mobile-, or desktop
applications.
